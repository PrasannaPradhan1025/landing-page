# landing-page
A skeleton of a landing page (only html and css). Its one of my initial projects for me to learn css. (Using TheOdinProject)
The project was a short one. Completed it in few hours with many breaks in-between. Though this project gave me a boost in my confidence about css. Finally understood the flexbox and the box model.
